The DNS filtering apparatus of China’s Great Firewall
(GFW) has evolved considerably over the past two decades.
However, most prior studies of China’s DNS filtering were performed over short time periods, leading to unnoticed changes
in the GFW’s behavior. In this study, we introduce GFWatch,
a large-scale, longitudinal measurement platform capable of
testing hundreds of millions of domains daily, enabling continuous monitoring of the GFW’s DNS filtering behavior.
We present the results of running GFWatch over a ninemonth period, during which we tested an average of 411M
domains per day and detected a total of 311K domains censored by GFW’s DNS filter. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the largest number of domains tested and censored domains
discovered in the literature. We further reverse engineer regular expressions used by the GFW and find 41K innocuous
domains that match these filters, resulting in overblocking
of their content. We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally
routable IPv4 addresses injected by the GFW, including addresses owned by US companies, such as Facebook, Dropbox,
and Twitter.
